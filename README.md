In developing the app, I leveraged Apple's Core ML and Foundation frameworks to construct a neural network tailored for real-time anomaly detection devices. Applying multiple batch learning techniques, I fine-tuned the neural network to ensure precise classification of abnormal events. Integrating Core ML into the system allowed for efficient inference, while Foundation streamlined the processes of data preprocessing and result interpretation.

The training phase involved working extensively with the DCASS dataset. It was a bit tedious due to the manual frame annotation required, but the effort paid off with the model achieving high accuracy and reliability in recognizing various abnormal occurrences.

In essence, the app represents a sophisticated solution for real-world anomaly detection in security applications, thanks to the meticulous optimization and integration efforts put into it.
